# Basketball-Stat-Taker
This was a project I worked in Introduction to Computer Science (CSCI 101). You can enter in stats into a data base or look up any players stats from any game in the season.

This does not have by any means any entire season worth of statitistcs, but all you have to do is find them however you choose to do so and 
add them to the program.
